 * This script is included to address a specific navigation issue where the first anchor tag
 * on the page was being redirected incorrectly to '/main' due to a problematic event listener
 * in other scripts or legacy code.
 * 
 * To prevent interference with the primary navigation links, this script does not add any
 * new event listeners. Instead, it serves as an override to remove or neutralize any previous
 * scripts causing navigation errors.
 * 
 * Including this file ensures that navigation links behave as expected without unwanted redirects.
